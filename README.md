Somayaji made a script in R which I am dying to reproduce in python using pandas and other great frameworks. His source file is:

> `ProjectProposal.R`

And the Resource for this learning is 
* _(This list may be continuously updated!)_

> __Data Analysis with Python Pandas

> [Source](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas)__

And, my Notebook which is a copy of the same tutorial in a notebook, whose file name is `pandas_tutorial_3mar15.ipynb` and can be found in SageMath Cloud.

## Begin with this:

`from pandas import DataFrame, read_csv`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`import pandas as pd`

`import sys`

`%matplotlib inline`

## Test your imports with this:

`print 'Python Version ' + sys.version`

`print 'Pandas Version ' + pd.__version__`

## And, Have fun!
